# A Revolutionary New AI Tool That Is Disrupting the Video Marketing Industry!

## Overview and Origin

The following case study is going to discuss software called Blotato that launched in 2024 and was created by Sabrina Ramonov.  Blotato combines AI, plus automations, plus prompts.

The idea for this project originated when Sabrina felt overwhelmed as a content creator. 

The owner of this software created it herself and did not use any outside funding.

## Business Activities

Sabrina built this tool to simplify the process of scaling and repurposing content. 

This tool solves the following problems:

It saves time, money and energy/resources (personal bandwidth) for creating content.
One does not need to pay for multiple tools 
A business owner/entrepreneur can focus more on the business, yet still be able to create high quality content 
The tool can be used quickly and easily.

This tool is for content creators.

The market size of content creators is massive and according to explodingtopics.com, there are over 200 million content creators in the world today. (Howarth)

I asked Sabrina what makes her tool unique and what unfair advantage does it have over its competitors?  She was proud to tell me that, “Blotato brings multiple disparate workflows into one app!”

This is the first version of her software and it uses the following technologies:
Firebase as a database 
Next.js as a full stack web app framework
Typescript, Tailwind, CSS and App Router were described as options within Next.js

Ultimately the software will connect to and work with Openai Chat GPT and social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. (Ramanov)

## Landscape

Blotato is in the field of social media marketing.

The creator economy is growing and according to explodingtopics.com, has seen an 11x increase since 2016. (Howarth)

Ms. Ramanov stated that Buffer and Jasper are her main competitors.  Other major competitors identified outside of the conversation with Sabrina included, but not limited to: repurpose.io, Opus Clip, Descript and Veed.io.
Results
I asked her what the core metrics are that she tracks and she told me, “I care if people publish posts.”  She was happy to tell me that the users of her software are “building their followers/audience and bringing in leads!”

Furthermore, I was curious to know how the software is performing with that being said and she humbly replied, “Good, but lots of room for improvement.”

My final question to Ms. Ramanov regarding metrics was, “How does the previously mentioned performance of the metrics stack up relative to its competitors?”  She simply replied, “No idea.”

## Recommendations

A coaching community to help beginner creators would be a possible service I suggest Ms. Ramanov offer along with her software.

Her main competitor, Buffer offers scheduling and has enterprise features for agencies that manage lots of clients, but I don’t see coaching offered and may differentiate her from others and provide value for her clients.

The main benefit to her company would be increased revenue, however when speaking with Ms. Ramanov, she was concerned about “more headache depending on the offer.”
The vision for Blatato does not foresee any additional technologies to complement what she has at this time.
